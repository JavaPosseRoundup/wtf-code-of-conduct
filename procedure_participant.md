This procedure has been adopted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled "[Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports)‚Äù.

1\. Keep in mind that all conference organizers and alumni participants will be introduced at the start of the conference.  Organizers and alumni participants will be given instructions on how to handle an incident.  
All of our organizers and participants are informed of the [code of conduct policy](code_of_conduct.md) and guide for handling harassment at the conference. *There will be a mandatory acknowledgement of this policy when registering for the conference.*

2\. Report the harassment incident (preferably in writing) to a conference organizer or alumni participants that you feel comfortable around. All reports are confidential. Please do not disclose public information about the incident until the organizers have had sufficient time in which to address the situation. This is as much for your safety and protection as it is the other participants.

When reporting the event to organizers or alumni, try to gather as much information as available but do not interview people about the incident. Organizers and alumni will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.

The important information consists of:

- Identifying information (name) of the participant doing the harassing
- The behavior that was in violation
- The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made)
- The circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people involved in or witness to the incident

The organizers are well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to further proceed with the situation.

3\. If everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security only at a victim's request.  If you do feel your safety in jeopardy please do not hesitate to contact local law enforcement by dialing 911. If you do not have a cell phone, you can use any available phone or simply ask another participant.

**Note**: Incidents that violate the Code of Conduct are extremely damaging to the community, and they
will not be tolerated. The silver lining is that, in many cases, these incidents present a chance for
the offenders, and the community at large, to grow, learn, and become better. WTF organizers and alumni request
that they be your first resource when reporting a WTF-related incident, so that they may enforce
the Code of Conduct and take quick action toward a resolution.

If at all possible, all reports should be made directly to [Bruce Eckel](mailto:mindviewinc@gmail.com) (Organizer).
