wtf-code-of-conduct
=====================

Thank you to the WTF18 attendees and Matt Brandt of Mozilla for encouraging the creation of a Code of Conduct for the Winter Tech Forum.  This initial Code of Conduct is based on a fork of the 2015 PyCon version.

We hope, as a conference community, that we can iterate and improve continually.

The version posted on this GitHub repository is a work in progress and should not be considered final until approved by the conference organizers and distributed to attendees for acceptance of these terms as a condition of registration, which will clearly state the posted revision tag.
